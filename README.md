# coppersulphate
- a bootstrap 4 site
- hosted on [github pages](https://andrewfandrew.github.io/coppersulphate/)
- the images used are delivered from another of my github repos
- the replacement is done using a custom jquery script

This is a one page site that features radio buttons and checkboxes replaced by images.
After testing it here i intend to duplicate this on on a drupal site.

## Branches
### yellowstone
- This uses Bootstrap 4 rather than Bootstrap 3
