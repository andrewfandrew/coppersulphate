# coppersulphate
- a bootstrap 4 site
- hosted on [github pages](https://andrewfandrew.github.io/coppersulphate/)
- the images used are delivered from another of my github repos
- the replacement is done using a custom jquery script
- uses fontawesome icons

This is a one page site that features radio buttons and checkboxes replaced by images.
After testing it here i intend to duplicate this on on a drupal site.

## Branches
### bootstrap3.3.7
- This uses Bootstrap version 3.3.7
- It uses glyphicons which are not available in Bootstrap version 4.x

## Notes
- The forms do not work on submission because github pages only permit static content
- This repository is to test the frontend design
